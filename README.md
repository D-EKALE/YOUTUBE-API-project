### YouTube API Project

This project is an exploration of the YouTube API using Python. The goal of the project is to analyze the performance of my YouTube channel by extracting data on my videos, such as view count, likes, comments, and publish dates.

### Technologies Used
The project was completed using Python 3.7 and the following libraries:

**pandas**
**requests**
**datetime**

### Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need to have a YouTube API key. You can obtain a key by following the instructions here.

Once you have a key, replace the API_KEY variable in the notebook with your key.

### Project Structure
The project is contained in a single Jupyter Notebook file, youtube_api.ipynb.

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

* **Importing Libraries**
* **Making API Requests**
* **Extracting Video Data**
* **Storing Data in a Pandas DataFrame**
* **Visualizing Data**

### Results
After running the notebook, you will have a Pandas DataFrame containing data on all of your YouTube videos, including view count, likes, comments, and publish dates. You can use this data to analyze the performance of your channel and gain insights into what types of videos perform best.

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of the YouTube API and how it can be used to extract valuable insights into your channel's performance. With a few lines of code, you can retrieve data on all of your videos and use it to make data-driven decisions about your content strategy.
